In this project i learnt to use Multithreading in Java using the ParallelStreams API and CompletableFuture API using the Hands-On approach.

I'm documenting all my learnings of multi threading, parallel programming features of java in this repository.

Concepts i learnt
 - Multi Threading using Threads class.
 - Create threads using Runnable interface
 - Limitations of Multi Threading using manually create and start threads approach.
 - Thread pool
 - Thread pool using executor service.
 - Fork/Join feature for parallel processing.
 - Limitations of Fork/Join 
 - streams and parallel streams, when to use what
 - limitations of parallel streams.
 - Completable Future
 - All methods of completable Future
 - such as CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(), thenApply(), thenCombine(), thenAccept(), allOf(), anyOf() and so on
 - Usage of completable future along with streams thus processing logic even faster
 - wrote unit test case for all the methods implemented.
